1- I have mappers to map objects between layers but didn't use them because 
too much boiler plate but I do get why using mappers would be best practice 

2 - design isn't the best as you havn't provided design AND I gave each product type 
differnet color to tell them apart

3- I didn't handle quanity in product if user added same item twice because the way to 
handle it wasn't clear at descrption there are solutions to handle it iof that's something
that was meant to part of the task but I didn't get that I got that you want me to naviagte and 
calculate price and that's it.

4- implemented one unit test for product use case 

5 - the naviagtion isn't the best as it wasn't really clear in the description

6- the timeline was the main issue but I tried to implement as much as possible following all the rules

7- willing to implement improvment if necessary
